##Introduction 
The Evidation Health Capstone project explores the hypothesis that among people with COVID, recurring daily activity patterns are chronically shifted for some people just after infection (or subsequent recovery). (Daza) Our main objective is to analyze the data from participants' daily physiological patterns pre-infections vs. post-infection/recovery so we can conclude if wearable devices can accurately check whether the device-wearer individual has COVID or not.
