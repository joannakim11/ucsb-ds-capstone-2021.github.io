# Introduction 
The Evidation Health Capstone project is diving into the hypothesis that among people with COVID-19, recurring daily activity patterns are chronically shifted for some people just after infections (or subsequent recovery). (Daza 2020) Our main object is to analyze participants' physiological patterns pre-infection vs. post-infection/recovery to see if wearable devices can accurately determine if the device-wearer has COVID or not. 

# Goals

# Initial Research Findings

### Sleep
From the Mishra et al paper, we have determined that sleep duration increases greatly after the onset of the outlying RHR-Diff signal. 

### Association between Heart Rate Signals and Symptoms
 In this limited sample, we did not detect any obvious association between the magnitude of RHR differences during alarm periods and symptom type or number, illness length or temperature.
